  > AutoBA Multi-Omics Analysis Benchmark is a custom evaluation framework consisting of 40 real-world bioinformatics analysis cases designed to assess automated AI agents on conventional multi-omics analysis tasks. The benchmark spans four major omics categories: genomics (15 cases including WGS assembly, somatic variant calling, ChIP-seq peak calling, ATAC-seq, bisulfite-seq, and long-read sequencing), transcriptomics (23 cases including bulk RNA-seq differential expression, fusion gene detection, alternative splicing, single-cell RNA-seq clustering, spatial transcriptomics, and various RNA modification analyses), proteomics (1 case on mass spectrometry protein quantification), and metabolomics (1 case on metabolite quantification). Each case is evaluated across three dimensions by bioinformatics experts: (1) quality of proposed analysis plans including appropriate software selection and parameter settings, (2) correctness of generated code for environment setup and tool installation, and (3) successful automated end-to-end execution. The benchmark emphasizes real-world complexity by requiring systems to autonomously handle software dependencies, debug execution errors, and adapt analysis strategies based on input data variations (e.g., selecting different tools for tumor samples with or without matched normal controls). Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on question-answering or code generation in isolation, this benchmark evaluates the complete pipeline from raw data input to final biological results, testing true automation capabilities essential for practical bioinformatics workflows.

  > A web-based interactive explorer for single-cell transcriptomics data that enables dynamic visualization, gene expression queries, and cell subset selection through an intuitive interface. Serves as both a data portal (CZ CELLxGENE Discover with 50M+ cells) and local visualization tool. AI agents can deploy cellxgene to provide interactive data exploration for collaborators, visualize AnnData objects with UMAP/t-SNE projections, dynamically color cells by gene expression or metadata, select and export cell subsets for re-analysis, integrate with computational notebooks, host datasets for publication sharing, and enable researchers to explore single-cell atlases without programming expertise.

- **[Napari](https://napari.org/)** `Napari Community`

  > A fast, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python designed for visualizing and analyzing large biological imaging datasets including microscopy, spatial transcriptomics imaging, and volumetric data. Features GPU-accelerated rendering and extensible plugin architecture. AI agents can invoke Napari to visualize spatial transcriptomics H&E images alongside gene expression, display multi-channel fluorescence microscopy with custom colormaps, perform manual annotation and segmentation of cells/nuclei, integrate deep learning models for automated image analysis, create 3D visualizations of volumetric imaging data, prototype image processing workflows interactively, and develop custom plugins for specialized imaging tasks.
